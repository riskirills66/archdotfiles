## Hyprland Desktop Setup Guide  

Welcome to your new Hyprland desktop environment! After enabling **SDDM**, you’ll need to log in and set up your wallpaper to ensure **Waybar** functions properly.  

### Initial Setup  
Once inside the Hyprland environment, a script will launch **Rofi** with three menu options:  
1. Select the first option: **`Wallpaper + Wal`**.  
2. Choose a wallpaper from the list (located in the **Downloads** directory). This will update both your desktop background and theme.  

### Changing Rofi Icon Themes  
1. Ensure you’ve downloaded additional icon themes (search online for "Gnome icon themes").  
2. Open the initiation menu: `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Return`.
3. Select the second option: **`Icon Selector`**.  
4. Pick an icon theme from the available list.  

### Updating the SDDM Wallpaper  
1. Open the initiation menu: `Ctrl + Shift + Alt + Return`.  
2. Select the third option: **`Change SDDM Wallpaper`**.  
3. Enter your **sudo** password when prompted.  
4. The script will automatically switch the **SDDM** theme to **Elarun** and set your current wallpaper as the SDDM background.  

### Notes  
- Ensure you have some images in your **Downloads** directory for the wallpaper selection menu to work. If no images are found, the script will automatically add a default wallpaper to the **Downloads** folder.
- Right-clicking on the power icon in the Waybar will bring up this initiation menu.
